An EC2 EBS disk is usually an xfs partition.
When a snapshot is made, it needs to be built into either an image, or a volume in order to be used.
You start a new EC2 with an image, or attach a volume to an existing EC2 and give it a name (for instance, /dev/sdh)

An xfs partition has a unique uuid that serves to prevent users from mounting the same filesystem twice. This may sometimes cause superblock problems, especially when mounting a snapshot on the same instance.
To circumvent this, mount has a -o nouuid option that allows users to still mount the filesystem.
Remember to specify that the filesystem is xfs with -t xfs.

Now you know the basics! Go out there and be evil!
