[AWS-Secgame] AWS-Secgame (name subject to change) is a bash-and-terraform deployment framework in order to setup "nice" and "fun" challenges to sensbilize to AWS vulnerabilities caused by misconfigurations.

SYNTAX   
	start.sh <command> argument

COMMANDS 

	help

		This command does not take an argument. It will display a brief helptext to the user, then exit gracefully.

	create

		Create is the go-to command to start a mission. It will generate everything you need for a new mission, them prompt the user for confirmation. Should it not be given, the program will delete anything it made.

		Legal arguments include:

	  	> mission1

		> mission2

		> mission3

		> mission4

		> mission5

		Each will create the associated mission. For more details on missions, consult the "Missions" part in this document, and the ADR.md document.

		Example: ./start.sh create mission1

	destroy

		Destroy takes a mission folder as argument (so missionX-id, with or without the trailing slash) and proceeds to ask the user for confirmation before deleting all resources. 

		Argument format: mission(number)-(id).

		Please note that if you create resources yourself during a mission, the program cannot delete them for you. You will have to remove them manually.

		Example: ./start.sh destroy mission1-aaaaaaaaaa
