echo "Agent, you are a godsent. Well done fetching those blueprints on that other server. The brass were delighted. You will find the usual pay on your usual account. \
We have another task for you. Our insider told us about a suspicious instance. Apparently, they intend to use it for a powerful wave of cyber-attacks. \
It was also brought to our attention that the instance contained sensitive data, but they have been redacted after some time. \
We have provided you with leaked AWS keys to their account, but they have little to no privilege. Your job is to access the instance, do some forensics on it in order to get the sensitive data out, then escalate your privileges and take it down.
We have great hopes for you.
