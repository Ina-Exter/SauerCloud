Hey there hacker,

Good job following the tracks. I could not try pulling out all that sensitive info myself. I was already making a fool of myself on many occasions, but they really thought I was a moron, while I was in fact a saboteur.
I'm the insider. Hope you got all that data out. Remember to delete this file when you see it, even though they might never find it (figures, eh, it's dotted, who'd have thought...).
Good on you if you did. I'll be staying undercover for a while if the need arises. If you're again pitted against Evilcorp, I'll give you a hand.

Cheers,
Matt Steraker, a.k.a Bob Lunder

PS: My real name's your "flag".
