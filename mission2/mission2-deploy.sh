echo "Wonderful job on that Evilcorp bucket, agent. I am glad you are on our side. I have further news for you. \
Word has it that Evilcorp started building a proof-of-concept data maintainment structure on AWS. \
It uses a bastion for easy and \"secure\" access, but they enabled SSH login with a password under some pressure from management. \
They also neglected to protect the instance against SSH bruteforce, so our servers in Russia and China were able to find it. \
Log in as eviluser on $bastion_ip, with password ConquerTheWorld. There might be other instances on the network, accessible from the bastion. \
With hope, you will be able to find the blueprints for their latest evil project on one such server. Good luck, agent..."  >> briefing.txt
